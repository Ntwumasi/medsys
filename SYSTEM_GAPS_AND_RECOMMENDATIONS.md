# MedSys EMR - System Gaps & Recommendations

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Reviewed Components:** Full-stack application (Frontend, Backend, Database, Workflows)

## Executive Summary

The MedSys EMR system has a solid foundation with core workflows implemented. However, there are several gaps and opportunities for improvement to enhance functionality, security, user experience, and clinical safety.

---

## 1. Critical Gaps (High Priority)

### 1.1 Patient Routing Implementation (INCOMPLETE)
**Location:** `client/src/pages/NurseDashboard.tsx:426-449`

**Issue:** The patient routing buttons (Send to Lab, Pharmacy, Imaging, Receptionist) are placeholders with `alert('Coming soon')` messages.

**Impact:** Nurses cannot route patients to ancillary services after doctor completion, breaking the workflow.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement routing endpoints in backend
- Create workflow states for each department
- Add queue management for Lab, Pharmacy, Imaging departments
- Update encounter status tracking to include these intermediate states

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

---

### 1.2 H&P Note Signing
**Issue:** H&P (History & Physical) notes are saved but not integrated with the existing note signing workflow.

**Impact:** H&P notes cannot be formally signed and locked, which is typically required for medical-legal compliance.

**Recommendation:**
- Display H&P notes in the "All Notes" section with formatting
- Add ability to sign H&P notes
- Consider special H&P display format (not just raw JSON)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

### 1.3 Invoice Generation Accuracy
**Location:** `server/src/controllers/workflowController.ts:checkInPatient`

**Issue:** Invoices are auto-generated with hardcoded consultation fees (GHS 50 for new, GHS 30 for returning), but no itemization for procedures, tests, or medications.

**Impact:**
- Incomplete billing
- No mechanism to add charges for services rendered
- Cannot track revenue accurately

**Recommendation:**
- Create charge master table for procedures/services
- Implement "Add Charge" functionality for doctors/nurses
- Auto-add charges when orders (Lab/Imaging/Pharmacy) are created
- Update invoice totals dynamically

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

---

### 1.4 Missing Appointment Integration
**Issue:** Appointments exist in the database but are not integrated with the check-in workflow.

**Impact:**
- Receptionists cannot see scheduled appointments when patients arrive
- No appointment-based patient expectations
- Walk-ins and appointments treated identically

**Recommendation:**
- Display today's appointments on receptionist dashboard
- Auto-populate patient info when checking in from appointment
- Track appointment vs walk-in metrics

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

---

## 2. Security & Compliance Gaps (High Priority)
