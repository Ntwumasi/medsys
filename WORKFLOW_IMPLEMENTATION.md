# Urgent Care Workflow Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of a role-based urgent care workflow system for tomorrow's demo.

## What's Been Built

### 1. Database Schema Enhancements

**New Tables Created:**
- `rooms` - Exam room management (8 rooms created by default)
- `clinical_notes` - Role-based notes with signing/sealing capability
- `pharmacy_orders` - Medication orders from doctors
- `alerts` - Nurse-to-doctor communication system

**Enhanced Tables:**
- `encounters` - Added workflow tracking fields:
  - `encounter_number` (auto-generated: ENC20231025-000001)
  - `room_id`, `nurse_id`, `receptionist_id`
  - `triage_time`, `triage_priority` (green/yellow/red)
  - `checked_in_at`, `nurse_started_at`, `doctor_started_at`, `completed_at`

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

### 3. Frontend Dashboards

#### Receptionist Dashboard (`/dashboard` for receptionist role)
**Features:**
- Patient search and check-in
- Real-time patient queue with color coding:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: 0-15 minutes wait
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: 15-30 minutes wait
  - ðŸ”´ Red: 30+ minutes wait
- Room assignment dropdown
- Nurse assignment dropdown
- Live room status board (Available/Occupied)

#### Nurse Dashboard (`/dashboard` for nurse role)
**Features:**
- Assigned patients list with priority colors
- Patient information panel
- Vital signs entry form (Temperature, BP, HR, RR, O2 Sat)
- Critical vitals auto-alert system
- Clinical notes (H&P and General)
- "Alert Doctor" button

#### Doctor Dashboard (`/dashboard` for doctor role)
**Features:**
- Room-based patient view
- Patient information with vital signs
- Order placement system:
  - Lab tests
  - Imaging/X-rays
  - Pharmacy/Medications
- Clinical notes with signing capability
- Note signing locks notes and updates billing
- Complete encounter & release room

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### Color Coding System
- Automatically calculated based on triage time
- Updates in real-time every 30 seconds
- Visual indicators: Green/Yellow/Red borders and backgrounds

#### Billing Integration
- Starts at $0 when patient checks in
- Auto-increments for:
  - Lab orders: +$75
  - Imaging orders: +$150
  - Pharmacy orders: +$25
  - Signed notes: +$150
- Invoice status changes to "pending" when notes signed

#### Chart Sealing
- Doctor signs notes via "Sign Note" button
- Signed notes become locked (is_locked = true)
- Cannot modify locked notes
- Can add new notes to encounter
- Each signed note adds to bill

#### Medical History Access
- Notes and encounters linked by patient_number
- View all past encounters via patient_id
- Clinical notes accessible across encounters
- Full history available in Patient Details page

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Make sure PostgreSQL is running
cd server

# Run the initial setup (creates base tables)
npm run db:setup

# Run the workflow migration (adds new tables and fields)
npx ts-node src/database/migration_workflow.ts
```

### 2. Create Test Users

You'll need to create users for each role. Use the registration endpoint or add directly to database:

```sql
-- Receptionist
INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, role, first_name, last_name, is_active)
VALUES ('receptionist@clinic.com', '$2b$10$...', 'receptionist', 'Jane', 'Smith', true);

-- Nurse
INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, role, first_name, last_name, is_active)
VALUES ('nurse@clinic.com', '$2b$10$...', 'nurse', 'Sarah', 'Johnson', true);

-- Doctor
INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, role, first_name, last_name, is_active)
VALUES ('doctor@clinic.com', '$2b$10$...', 'doctor', 'John', 'Williams', true);
```

Or use the API:
```bash
# Register users via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"receptionist@clinic.com","password":"demo123","role":"receptionist","first_name":"Jane","last_name":"Smith"}'
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Start client
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Create Test Patients

Before testing workflow, create 2-3 test patients via the Patient Registration page or API.

## Demo Workflow

5. Click "Check In Patient"
6. Patient appears in queue with GREEN status
7. Assign room from dropdown
8. Assign nurse from dropdown

### Step 2: Nurse Workflow
1. Login as nurse@clinic.com
2. See assigned patient in left panel with color code
3. Click patient to select
4. Enter vital signs:
   - Temperature: 98.6Â°F
   - BP: 120/80
   - Heart Rate: 72
   - Respiratory Rate: 16
   - O2 Saturation: 98%
5. Click "Save Vital Signs"
6. Add H&P note describing patient history
7. Click "Alert Doctor - Patient Ready"

### Step 3: Doctor Workflow
1. Login as doctor@clinic.com
2. See patients organized by room number
3. Click on patient's room
4. Review vital signs and chief complaint
5. View patient chart link (full history)
6. Place orders:
   - Lab: "CBC with Differential"
   - Imaging: "Chest X-Ray, AP and Lateral"
   - Pharmacy: "Aspirin 81mg, once daily, oral, 30 tablets"
7. Add doctor's note with assessment and plan
8. Click "Sign Note" to lock and bill
9. Click "Complete Encounter & Release Room"

### Step 4: Watch Color Coding
- After 15 minutes: Status changes to YELLOW
- After 30 minutes: Status changes to RED
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

## API Quick Reference

### Check-In Flow
```javascript
// 1. Check in patient
POST /api/workflow/check-in
{
  "patient_id": 1,
  "chief_complaint": "Chest pain",
  "encounter_type": "walk-in"
}

// 2. Assign room
POST /api/workflow/assign-room
{
  "encounter_id": 1,
  "room_id": 3
}

// 3. Assign nurse
POST /api/workflow/assign-nurse
{
  "encounter_id": 1,
  "nurse_id": 5
}
```

### Nurse Flow
```javascript
// 1. Add vitals
POST /api/workflow/nurse/vitals
{
  "encounter_id": 1,
  "vital_signs": {
    "temperature": 98.6,
    "temperature_unit": "F",
    "blood_pressure_systolic": 120,
    "blood_pressure_diastolic": 80,
    "heart_rate": 72,
    "respiratory_rate": 16,
    "oxygen_saturation": 98
  }
}

// 2. Alert doctor
POST /api/workflow/nurse/alert-doctor
{
  "encounter_id": 1,
  "message": "Patient ready for evaluation"
}
```

### Doctor Flow
```javascript
// 1. Place lab order
POST /api/orders/lab
{
  "patient_id": 1,
  "encounter_id": 1,
  "test_name": "CBC with Differential",
  "priority": "routine"
}

// 2. Add note and sign
POST /api/clinical-notes
{
  "encounter_id": 1,
  "patient_id": 1,
  "note_type": "doctor_general",
  "content": "Assessment and plan..."

}
```

## Notes for Demo

1. **Color Coding**: Wait times are calculated from triage_time, so color changes happen automatically
2. **Billing**: Invoice starts at $0 and increments with each order and signed note
3. **Chart Sealing**: Once signed, notes are locked but new notes can be added
4. **Medical History**: All encounters for a patient are accessible via their patient_number
5. **Room Status**: Automatically updates when rooms are assigned/released
6. **Auto-Refresh**: Dashboards refresh every 30 seconds to show real-time updates

## Troubleshooting

- **Database connection error**: Make sure PostgreSQL is running
- **Token expired**: Re-login to get new JWT token
- **Can't assign room**: Check if room is already occupied
- **Can't modify note**: Note has been signed and is locked
- **Orders not showing**: Check encounter_id is correct

## Next Steps for Production

1. Add real-time updates with WebSockets
2. Implement patient discharge process
3. Add insurance verification at check-in
4. Create detailed billing report
5. Add lab result entry system
6. Implement medication allergy checking
7. Add notification system for critical vitals
8. Create printable encounter summary

**Demo Ready!** All features are implemented and ready for testing. Just need to run the database migrations and create test users.
